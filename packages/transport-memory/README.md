A [libp2p transport](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/transports/overview/)
that operates in-memory only.

This is intended for testing and can only be used to connect two libp2p nodes
that are running in the same process.

## Example

```TypeScript
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { memory } from '@libp2p/memory'
import { multiaddr } from '@multiformats/multiaddr'

const listener = await createLibp2p({
  addresses: {
    listen: [
      '/memory/address-a'
    ]
  },
  transports: [
    memory()
  ]
})

const dialer = await createLibp2p({
  transports: [
    memory()
  ]
})

const ma = multiaddr('/memory/address-a')

// dial the listener, timing out after 10s
const connection = await dialer.dial(ma, {
  signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10_000)
})

// use connection...
```

# Install

```console
$ npm i @libp2p/memory
```

## Browser `<script>` tag

Loading this module through a script tag will make its exports available as `Libp2pMemory` in the global namespace.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@libp2p/memory/dist/index.min.js"></script>
