> Don't use this module

This module is a naive implementation of pubsub. It broadcasts all messages to all network peers, cannot provide older messages and has no protection against bad actors.

It exists for academic purposes only, you should not use it in production.

Instead please use [gossipsub](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainsafe/libp2p-gossipsub) - a more complete implementation which is also compatible with floodsub.

## Example - Configuring libp2p to use floodsub

```TypeScript
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { floodsub } from '@libp2p/floodsub'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    pubsub: floodsub()
  }
  //... other options
})
await node.start()

node.services.pubsub.subscribe('fruit')
node.services.pubsub.addEventListener('message', (evt) => {
  console.log(evt)
})

node.services.pubsub.publish('fruit', new TextEncoder().encode('banana'))
```

# Install

```console
$ npm i @libp2p/floodsub
```

## Browser `<script>` tag

Loading this module through a script tag will make its exports available as `Libp2pFloodsub` in the global namespace.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@libp2p/floodsub/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```
