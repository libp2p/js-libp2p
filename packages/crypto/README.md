# About

<!--

!IMPORTANT!

Everything in this README between "# About" and "# Install" is automatically
generated and will be overwritten the next time the doc generator is run.

To make changes to this section, please update the @packageDocumentation section
of src/index.js or src/index.ts

To experiment with formatting, please run "npm run docs" from the root of this
repo and examine the changes made.

-->

The `libp2p-crypto` library depends on the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) in the browser. Web Crypto is available in all modern browsers, however browsers restrict its usage to [Secure Contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts).

This means you will not be able to use some `@libp2p/crypto` functions in the browser when the page is served over HTTP.\*

To enable the Web Crypto API and allow `@libp2p/crypto` to work fully, please serve your page over HTTPS.

# Install

```console
$ npm i @libp2p/crypto
```

## Browser `<script>` tag

Loading this module through a script tag will make its exports available as `Libp2pCrypto` in the global namespace.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@libp2p/crypto/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```
