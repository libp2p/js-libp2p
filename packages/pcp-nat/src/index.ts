/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * The service exported by this module attempts to configure NAT hole punching
 * via PCP (Port Control Protocol).
 *
 * This will make your node publicly accessible from the internet.
 *
 * For this to work there are some prerequisites:
 *
 * 1. Your router must have PCP support enabled
 * 2. Your libp2p node must be listening on a non-loopback IPv4 or IPv6 address
 * 3. You must not be [double-NATed](https://kb.netgear.com/30186/What-is-double-NAT-and-why-is-it-bad) by your ISP
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
 * import { tcp } from '@libp2p/tcp'
 * import { PCPNAT } from '@libp2p/pcp-nat'
 *
 * const node = await createLibp2p({
 *   addresses: {
 *     listen: [
 *       '/ip6/2001:db8:85a3:8d3:aaaa:aaaa:aaaa:aaaa/tcp/0'
 *     ]
 *   },
 *   transports: [
 *     tcp()
 *   ],
 *   services: {
 *     // IPv6 Global Unicast Address (GUA) LAN address of your router
 *     pcpNat: pcpNAT("2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348", {
 *      autoConfirmAddress: true
 *    })
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
