/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * The service exported by this module attempts to configure NAT hole punching
 * via UPnP.
 *
 * This will make your node publicly accessible from the internet.
 *
 * For this to work there are some prerequisites:
 *
 * 1. Your router must have UPnP support enabled
 * 2. Your libp2p node must be listening on a non-loopback IPv4 address
 * 3. You must not be [double-NATed](https://kb.netgear.com/30186/What-is-double-NAT-and-why-is-it-bad) by your ISP
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
 * import { tcp } from '@libp2p/tcp'
 * import { uPnPNAT } from '@libp2p/upnp-nat'
 *
 * const node = await createLibp2p({
 *   addresses: {
 *     listen: [
 *       '/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/0'
 *     ]
 *   },
 *   transports: [
 *     tcp()
 *   ],
 *   services: {
 *     upnpNAT: uPnPNAT()
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @example Manually specifying gateways and external ports
 *
 * Some ISP-provided routers are underpowered and may require rebooting before
 * they will respond to SSDP M-SEARCH messages.
 *
 * You can manually specify your external address and/or gateways, though note
 * that those gateways will still need to have UPnP enabled in order for libp2p
 * to configure mapping of external ports (for IPv4) and/or opening pinholes in
 * the firewall (for IPv6).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
 * import { tcp } from '@libp2p/tcp'
 * import { uPnPNAT } from '@libp2p/upnp-nat'
 *
 * const node = await createLibp2p({
 *   addresses: {
 *     listen: [
 *       '/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/0'
 *     ]
 *   },
 *   transports: [
 *     tcp()
 *   ],
 *   services: {
 *     upnpNAT: uPnPNAT({
 *       // manually specify external address - this will normally be an IPv4
 *       // address that the router is performing NAT with
 *       externalAddress: '92.137.164.96',
 *       gateways: [
 *         // an IPv4 gateway
 *         'http://192.168.1.1:8080/path/to/descriptor.xml',
 *         // an IPv6 gateway
 *         'http://[xx:xx:xx:xx]:8080/path/to/descriptor.xml'
 *       ]
 *     })
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
