> libp2p-daemon JavaScript implementation

# Install

```console
$ npm i @libp2p/daemon
```

# Specs

The specs for the daemon are currently housed in the go implementation. You can read them at [libp2p/go-libp2p-daemon](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-daemon/blob/master/specs/README.md)

# Usage

```console
$ jsp2pd --help
```

For a full list of options, you can run help `jsp2pd --help`.
Running the defaults, `jsp2pd`, will start the daemon and bind it to a local unix socket path.
Daemon clients will be able to communicate with the daemon over that unix socket.

As an alternative, you can use this daemon with a different version of libp2p as the one specified in `package.json`. You just need to define its path through an environment variable as follows:

```console
$ LIBP2P_JS=/path/to/js-libp2p/src/index.js jsp2pd
```
