A [libp2p transport](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/transports/overview/) based on [WebTransport](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/).

> ⚠️ **Note**
>
> This WebTransport implementation currently only allows dialing to other nodes. It does not yet allow listening for incoming dials. This feature requires QUIC support to land in Node JS first.
>
> QUIC support in Node JS is actively being worked on. You can keep an eye on the progress by watching the [related issues on the Node JS issue tracker](https://github.com/nodejs/node/labels/quic)

## Example

```TypeScript
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { webTransport } from '@libp2p/webtransport'
import { noise } from '@chainsafe/libp2p-noise'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  transports: [
    webTransport()
  ],
  connectionEncrypters: [
    noise()
  ]
})
```

# Install

```console
$ npm i @libp2p/webtransport
```
