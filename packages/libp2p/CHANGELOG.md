* the autodialer has been removed as well as the corresponding config keys
* The `.code` property has been removed from most errors, use `.name` instead
* removes `localPeer: PeerId` first parameter from `secureInbound` and `secureOutbound` in `ConnectionEncrypter`
* * The `notifyOnTransient` property of `libp2p.register` has been renamed `notifyOnLimitedConnection`
* `@libp2p/interface` no longer exports a `CustomEvent` polyfill

### BREAKING CHANGES

* new configuration for deciding the implementation of pubsub to be used.
In this context, the experimental flags were also removed. See the README for the latest usage.
* The ipfs interface specified that options
should be provided after the handler, not before.
https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/v0.109.0/SPEC/PUBSUB.md#pubsubsubscribe

This corrects the order of parameters. See the jsdocs examples
for subscribe to see how it should be used.
