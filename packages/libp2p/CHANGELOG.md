### BREAKING CHANGES

* new configuration for deciding the implementation of pubsub to be used.
In this context, the experimental flags were also removed. See the README for the latest usage.
* The ipfs interface specified that options
should be provided after the handler, not before.
https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/v0.109.0/SPEC/PUBSUB.md#pubsubsubscribe

This corrects the order of parameters. See the jsdocs examples
for subscribe to see how it should be used.
