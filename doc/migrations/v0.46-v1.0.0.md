## AutoNAT

The AutoNAT service is now published in its own package.

**Before**

```ts
import { autoNATService } from 'libp2p/autonat'
```

**After**

```ts
import { autoNATService } from '@libp2p/autonat'
```

## KeyChain

The KeyChain object is no longer included on Libp2p and must be instantiated explicitly if desired.

**Before**

```ts
import type { KeyChain } from '@libp2p/interface/keychain'

const libp2p = await createLibp2p(...)

const keychain: KeyChain = libp2p.keychain
```

**After**

```ts
import { keychain, type Keychain } from '@libp2p/keychain'

const libp2p = await createLibp2p({
  ...
  services: {
    keychain: keychain()
  }
})

const keychain: Keychain = libp2p.services.keychain
```

## Pnet

The pnet module is now published in its own package.

**Before**

```ts
import { preSharedKey, generateKey } from 'libp2p/pnet'
```

**After**

```ts
import { preSharedKey, generateKey } from '@libp2p/pnet'
```

## Metrics

The following metrics were renamed:

`libp2p_dialler_pending_dials` => `libp2p_dial_queue_pending_dials`
`libp2p_dialler_in_progress_dials` => `libp2p_dial_queue_in_progress_dials`

## Connection Manager

We now only dial one peer at a time as this is a more efficient use of resources.  This means that the `maParallelDialsPerPeer` option has been removed.
