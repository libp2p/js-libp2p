## Type imports

All exports from `@libp2p/interface` and `@libp2p/interface-internal` are
now exported from the root of the module, no more having to work out which
subpath to import from.

**Before**

```ts
import type { PeerId } from '@libp2p/interface/peer-id'
import type { Connection } from '@libp2p/interface/connection'
import type { Stream } from '@libp2p/interface/stream-muxer'
```

**After**

```ts
import type { Connection, PeerId, Stream } from '@libp2p/interface'
```

## Extracted modules

`js-libp2p` has always had a focus on being a modular, composable ecosystem of
modules. `v1.x.x` takes this further and extracts all of the optional
functionality out of the core and into modules that you can include in your app
if you need them, or omit them if you don't.

### Services

These modules can be configured as services to enable optional functionality.

#### AutoNAT

The AutoNAT service is now published in its own package.

**Before**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { autoNATService } from 'libp2p/autonat'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    autoNAT: autoNATService()
  }
})
```

**After**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { autoNAT } from '@libp2p/autonat'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    autoNAT: autoNAT()
  }
})
```

#### Ping

The Ping service is now published in its own package.

**Before**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { pingService } from 'libp2p/ping'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    ping: pingService()
  }
})
```

**After**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { ping } from '@libp2p/ping'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    ping: ping()
  }
})
```

#### Identify

The Identify service is now published in its own package.

**Before**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { identifyService } from 'libp2p/identify'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    identify: identifyService()
  }
})
```

**After**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { identify } from '@libp2p/identify'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    identify: identify()
  }
})
```

#### DCUtR

The DCUtR service is now published in its own package.

**Before**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { dcutrService } from 'libp2p/dcutr'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    dcutr: dcutrService()
  }
})
```

**After**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { dcutr } from '@libp2p/dcutr'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    dcutr: dcutr()
  }
})
```

#### Fetch

The Fetch service is now published in its own package.

**Before**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { fetchService } from 'libp2p/fetch'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    fetch: fetchService()
  }
})
```

**After**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { fetch } from '@libp2p/fetch'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    fetch: fetch()
  }
})
```


#### UPnPNat

The UPnPNat service module is now published in its own package.

**Before**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { uPnPNATService } from 'libp2p/upnp-nat'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    uPnPNAT: uPnPNATService()
  }
})
```

**After**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { uPnPNAT } from '@libp2p/upnp-nat'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    uPnPNAT: uPnPNAT()
  }
})
```

#### Perf

The Perf service module exports have been renamed in line with the other changes
here.

**Before**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { perService } from '@libp2p/perf'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    perf: perService()
  }
})
```

**After**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { perf } from '@libp2p/perf'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  services: {
    perf: perf()
  }
})
```

### Connection encryption

#### Plaintext

The Plaintext connection encrypter module is now published in its own package.

Note that it is still insecure and should not be used in production.

**Before**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { plaintext } from 'libp2p/insecure'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  connectionEncryption: [
    plaintext: plaintext()
  ]
})
```

**After**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { plaintext } from '@libp2p/plaintext'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  connectionEncryption: [
    plaintext: plaintext()
  ]
})
```


### Misc

#### KeyChain

The KeyChain object is no longer included on Libp2p and must be instantiated
explicitly if desired.

**Before**

```ts
import type { KeyChain } from '@libp2p/interface/keychain'

const libp2p = await createLibp2p(...)

const keychain: KeyChain = libp2p.keychain
```

**After**

```ts
import { keychain, type Keychain } from '@libp2p/keychain'

const libp2p = await createLibp2p({
  ...
  services: {
    keychain: keychain()
  }
})

const keychain: Keychain = libp2p.services.keychain
```

### Pnet

The pnet module is now published in its own package.

**Before**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { preSharedKey, generateKey } from 'libp2p/pnet'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  // ...other options
  connectionProtector: preSharedKey({
    psk: generateKey(new Uint8Array(95))
  })
})
```

**After**

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { preSharedKey, generateKey } from '@libp2p/pnet'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  // ...other options
  connectionProtector: preSharedKey({
    psk: generateKey(new Uint8Array(95))
  })
})
```

## Metrics

The following metrics were renamed:

`libp2p_dialler_pending_dials` => `libp2p_dial_queue_pending_dials`
`libp2p_dialler_in_progress_dials` => `libp2p_dial_queue_in_progress_dials`

## Connection Manager

The observed behavior of dialing peers has been that given a list of supported addresses, if any one routable address would succeed then all would succeed and that if any routable address would fail then all would fail.

Consequently the previous dial behaviour of dialing all available addresses (up to a concurrency limit) and cancelling any in-flight dials when the first succeeds was a very inefficient use of resources.

Since `libp2p@0.46.10` we have only dialed one address at a time for each peer by setting the default value of the `ConnectionManager`'s `maxParallelDialsPerPeer` option to `1`.  As of `libp2p@1.0.0` this option has been removed.
