> JavaScript implementation of the WebSockets module that libp2p uses and that implements the interface-transport interface

## Description

`libp2p-websockets` is the WebSockets implementation compatible with libp2p.

**Note:** This module uses [pull-streams](https://pull-stream.github.io) for all stream based interfaces.

## Example

```
TODO
```

## Installation

### npm

```sh
> npm i libp2p-websockets
```

### This module uses `pull-streams`

We expose a streaming interface based on `pull-streams`, rather then on the Node.js core streams implementation (aka Node.js streams). `pull-streams` offers us a better mechanism for error handling and flow control guarantees. If you would like to know more about why we did this, see the discussion at this [issue](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/362).

You can learn more about pull-streams at:

- [pull-streams documentation](https://pull-stream.github.io/)

#### Converting `pull-streams` to Node.js Streams

If you are a Node.js streams user, you can convert a pull-stream to a Node.js stream using the module [`pull-stream-to-stream`](https://github.com/dominictarr/pull-stream-to-stream), giving you an instance of a Node.js stream that is linked to the pull-stream. For example:

```js
const pullToStream = require('pull-stream-to-stream')

const nodeStreamInstance = pullToStream(pullStreamInstance)
// nodeStreamInstance is an instance of a Node.js Stream
```
